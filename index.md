### About
*Spring Brainhack Boston 2024* is being held as a hybrid event. The in-person location is at:

**[UMass Boston Campus Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d34dhk1tU7y6Fu5U7)** <BR>
Room U03-3000A (3rd floor, Point Lounge)

**There are shuttle buses from the redline JFK/UMass that go right to the Campus Center.**

*Spring Brainhack Boston 2024* is inspired by the [BRAIN Initiative CONNECTS program](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/highlights-announcements/nih-brain-initiative-launches-projects-develop-innovative-technologies-map-brain-incredible-detail), and particularly [CONNECTS projects on multi-modal imaging of fiber tracts](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/3TvO-D_5_0-AyCKL3EMDUg/projects). Topics of potential interest include:
- Remote computation and visualization for large datasets
- Integration of imaging data across modalities and scales
- Standardization and visualization of fiber tract data
