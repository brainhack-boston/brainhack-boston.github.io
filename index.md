### About

*Brainhack Global* is a unique conference that convenes researchers from across the globe and a myriad of disciplines to work together on innovative projects related to neuroscience.

*Brainhack Boston 2023* is inspired by the [BRAIN Initiative CONNECTS program](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/highlights-announcements/nih-brain-initiative-launches-projects-develop-innovative-technologies-map-brain-incredible-detail), and particularly [CONNECTS projects on multi-modal imaging of fiber tracts](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/3TvO-D_5_0-AyCKL3EMDUg/projects). Topics of potential interest include:
- Remote computation and visualization for large datasets
- Integration of imaging data across modalities and scales
- Standardization and visualization of fiber tract data
