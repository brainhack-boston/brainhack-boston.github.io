### About
Brainhack Boston 2024 is organized in coordination with Brainhack Global 2024.

Brainhack Global is a unique conference that convenes researchers from across the globe and a myriad of disciplines to work together on innovative projects related to neuroscience.

Brainhack Boston 2024 is focused on tool development for the [BRAIN Initiative CONNECTS program](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/highlights-announcements/nih-brain-initiative-launches-projects-develop-innovative-technologies-map-brain-incredible-detail), and particularly CONNECTS projects on multi-modal imaging of fiber tracts. These projects aim to collect, analyze, and integrate diffusion MRI and microscopy data towards constructing a multi-scale human connectome.
