## Realtime visualization/analysis of BOLD data

Realtime fmri paradigms require a mechanism to stream BOLD data from the MR scanner to an external computer.  Given such a mechanism, what else is possible?  What other monitoring, visualization, or realtime paradigm can this mechanism enable?

## FreeSurfer and the Common Workflow Language

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a specification for describing analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments.  This project aims to specify FreeSurfer's recon-all stream in the common workflow language.  What is the best way to go about this and what does this enable?

## TRACULA and Freesurfer cortical thickness

TRACULA provides probabily maps of main white matteri (WM)  structures allowing for statistical analysis of miscrostructural information such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean/radial/axial diffusivity (MD/RD/AD). Changes in grey matter (GM) cortical thickness might have an impact on the connecting white matter and vice-versa. Integrating TRACULA with FreeSurfer cortical thickness analysis extend the WM/GM analysis.

## Group short connection streamlines based on cortical structures

Most of the streamline white matter (WM) clustering methods focus on long range connection streamlines and little attention has been payed to short connection streamlines. Short connection streamlines can be correlated with cortical thickness changes. The goal is to compare the effect of grouping short connection streamlines based on cortical regions they connect, and compare it to grouping them based on a Euclidean space distance (spatial distance) or an anatomical distance such as the one defined in AnatomiCuts.

## Streamline visualization

Visualizing million of 3D curves inside the brain can be hard. The main goal of this project is to explore alternatives for visualizing white matter connections, such as short connections on the flat surface (or the ones cortical structures).
